One thing beginners struggle with LaTeX is the install of packages. For
almost everything you want to do there is a package for that. I will
show you an easy way to install them. Unless you have installed a
complete distribution of LaTeX (for example, all the TeXLive
distribution, which is now the standard on Linux), you will have to
install a package at one time or another.

** What is a LaTeX package and how can we obtain them ?

If you are in a hurry, just get the adequate .sty file from the web and
it should get the job done. Otherwise, you will find on the CTAN website
a bundle containing a .tex file which you will have to "compile" into a
.sty .

Then, several possibilities exist :

- Copy the .sty to your LaTeX directory
- Copy the .sty to the folder containing your work
- Use a custom folder given by LaTeX

The first solution needs administrator rights and the second is only a
temporary workaround. We will use the last one. If you want to install
the package xfig, just create in your home directory the following
arborescence texmf/tex put your .sty inside an xfig folder . There, you
are done !

** I still want to install it for all users, how can I do ?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: i-still-want-to-install-it-for-all-users-how-can-i-do
   :END:
The procedure is the same, except you will put it inside the install
directory of TeXlive. It should be /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/. Then
update the package list with the texhash command and you are done !
