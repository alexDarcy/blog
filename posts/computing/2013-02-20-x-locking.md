A small post about protecting your desktop.
<!--more-->

If you are using Gnome, you should be able to lock the screen with <ic>Ctr-ALt-Del</ic>.

If you prefere ligthweight programs, I tried <ic>slock</ic> but did not really
like it as it is not clear when the deskop is locked. <ic>i3Lock</ic> is similar
but is an improved version. Finally, <ic>xtrlock</ic> is the one I use currently.
