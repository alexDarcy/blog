Here is a small summary from my journey from vim to using Emacs for (almost) everything !
<!--more-->
After using ViM for a few years, I wanted to try Emacs. I can summarize months of trial and errors into this single sentence :

> ViM users, use doom-emacs and profit 

Now that I got that of the way, here are the following paths I've tried. I've summarize as much as possible to avoid a long read :

1. Using pure emacs
I've started a clean `.emacs.el` and discovered emacs mappings and some plugins.
2. Discovering evil
It felt so good to be back to vim mapping after emacs 
3. [Using Purcell starter kit](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d)
Quite nice but ...
4. Switching to doom emacs 
This made my day/month/year. I've even donated to the developer. Start here !!

## Best plugins
I've put here plugins I deem essential for everyday use. I will not try to
convince you but install, play with it and you should be pleased :)
Also, the plugins in [https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs](doom-emacs) are marked as _(doom)_.

Start here :
- [evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil) (doom) : ViM emulation in Emacs. No
  life without it. See also
  [evil-collection](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection) (doom) for having
  vim mapping "everywhere"
- [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org4beginners.html) (doom) :
  I use it to plan my shopping, tasks, studying, movies list... Numerous
  tutorials are availables online but here the official documentation (quick
  version)

Build on it :
- evil surround
- avy + easymotion (line motion) (snipe ?)
- ivy (vs helm)
- completion 
- magit
- org-ref (biblio ??)

Under test
