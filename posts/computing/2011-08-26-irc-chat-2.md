Following the post on chatting in MSN, here is a configuration for your Irssi client.
<!--more-->

## Using irssi
Navigating between the windows can be done with:

* backward and forward: <ic> Meta-p</ic> and <ic>Meta-n</ic>
* switch to the window number 1: <ic>Meta-1</ic> or <ic>Esc-1</ic>

Any change in irssi configuration must be saved with <ic>/save</ic>.
If you want to switch to utf8 encoding it is done with :

``` bash
/set term_charset UTF-8
```

Finally, exiting is done with <ic>/quit</ic>.

## Irssi and IRC
You can add a server, say irc.efnet.no, and a channel named mychan in irssi config. For connecting automatically, do not forget the <ic>-auto</ic> option :

``` bash
/server add -auto -network EFnet irc.efnet.no 6667
/channel add -auto #plouf EFnet 
```

Receiving or sending files over the IRC network is done with :

``` bash
/dcc get senderNick
/dcc send receiverNick myFile
```

## Customizing irssi
Several themes are available for irssi. Once you  have chosen one of them, put it in <ic><!--more-->/.irssi</ic> and activate it. If you have chose the xchat theme :

``` bash
/set theme xchat 
```

## Bitlebee tips
_Note : Bitlbee commands do not start with a slash, contrary to irssi commands._
First you can deactivate these annoying status change like

``` bash
14:26 -!- ServerMode/&bitlbee [+v friend1] by localhost
```

Enter the following

``` bash
/ignore &bitlbee MODES 
```

List all your contacts with <ic>blist</ic>.
Friends are named after their mail address so you can rename them :

``` bash
rename friend1 MyDearFriend 
```

Again, any change in bitlbee configuration must be saved with <ic>save</ic>.
