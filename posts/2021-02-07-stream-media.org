Today, I'll show you how to configure FreeBSD to share media content
over the network using NFS, and how to configure Kodi to access it from
your TV.

** Server
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: server
   :END:
First define which folders will be accessible to whom. In
=/etc/exports=, I share /media to everyone on my network (192.168.1.**)

#+begin_src shell
  /media  -alldirs -maproot=root -network=192.168.1.0/24
#+end_src

Note the syntax is different from Linux !

Then simply activate NFS by adding in =/etc/rc.conf= :

#+begin_src shell
  # NFS for Kodi
  # Order is important : rpcbind first, then nfs and mountd
  rpcbind_enable="YES"
  nfs_server_enable="YES"
  weak_mountd_authentication="yes"
  mountd_enable="YES"
  nfs_client_enable="YES"
#+end_src

NB:Â The Kodi wiki mentions lockd and statd but it is unnecessary.

Reboot or start the service (start rpcbind first, otherwise it will not
work !)

#+begin_src shell
  $ service rpcbind start
  $ service nfsd start
#+end_src

Check the export is working :

#+begin_src shell
  $ showmount -e
  Exports list on localhost:
  /media                             192.168.1.0
#+end_src

** TV
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: tv
   :END:
We will use the Kodi application. Add a new source by choosing NFS and
entering by hand : (the folder is not found automatically)

=nfs://192.168.1.XXX/media=

where XXX is the end of the server IP. Profit !
