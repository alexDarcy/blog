Here are some tricks I have found for LaTeX. This section will be
updated from time to time.

** Changing fonts size
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: changing-fonts-size
   :END:
If you are using the article class for instance, three different font
sizes are available : 10,11,12 pt.Â You can use it like this :

#+begin_src latex
  \documentclass[10pt]{article}
#+end_src

What if you want to use to other sizes ? Pre-built functions like \tiny
do not work on the section titles. The solution is to redefine fontsize:

#+begin_src latex
  \documentclass{article}
  \begin{document}
  \tiny
  \def\fontsize#1#2{} 
  This is a test (hey,hey).
  \section{One}
  This is a test (hey,hey).
  \end{document}
#+end_src
