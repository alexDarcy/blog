Some tips I collected about FreeBSD.

** Mount LVM Linux volumes from FreeBSD
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: mount-lvm-linux-volumes-from-freebsd
   :END:
You can have read and write access to LVM volumes, even though FreeBSD
itself cannot use LVM :

#+begin_src shell
  kldload fuse
  kldload /boot/kernel/geom_linux_lvm.ko # This will make /dev/linux_vm appear
  fuse-ext2 -o rw+ /dev/linux_lvm/VolGroup00-lvhome /Linux
#+end_src

where VolGroup00 is my physical volume, lvhome is my logical volume and
/Linux the mountpoint. -o rw+ is used for read and write access.

I have also posted this information on the
[[https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/howto-mounting-ext4-in-lvm2.29659/#post-386112][FreeBSD
forums]].

** Fix ugly fonts in Firefox
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: fix-ugly-fonts-in-firefox
   :END:
I followed the instructions on
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/freebsd/comments/7kqr5l/improving_firefox_fonts/][this
reddit thread]]. What worked for me was to disable bitmap fonts

#+begin_src shell
  ln -s /usr/local/etc/fonts/conf.avail/70-no-bitmaps.conf
  /usr/local/etc/fonts/conf.d/
#+end_src

** Redshift and Nvidia driver
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: redshift-and-nvidia-driver
   :END:
Redshift must be started with the latitude and longitude (get it from
Google Maps from example) :

#+begin_src shell
  redshift -l 44.148053:16.192406
#+end_src

If you have a =Failed to start adjustment method randr=, it may be
because you are note using the Nvidia driver. Install the latest driver

#+begin_src shell
  pkg install nvidia-driver
#+end_src

And create a configuration file for Xorg by following
[[https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/howto-setup-xorg-with-nvidias-driver.52311/][this
thread]]. Restart X and check with nvidia-settings than you are running
the Nvidia driver.

** Uninstalling a program
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: uninstalling-a-program
   :END:
You can go into the ports, and uninstall it manually :

#+begin_src shell
  $ cd /usr/ports/myapp && make deinstall
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src shell
  $ pkg delete myapp
#+end_src

** Extract useful information from /usr/ports/UPDATING
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: extract-useful-information-from-usrportsupdating
   :END:
You can use pkg updating as
[[http://forums.freebsd.org/showthread.php?t=21142][described here]].

** Running Linux in Virtualbox from FreeBSD
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: running-linux-in-virtualbox-from-freebsd
   :END:
First, you will need to install Virtualbox on FreeBSD and start it with
Virtualbox. Then you have to install addition on the guest OS. Look in
the Virtualbox menu, at /Install additions/. Now run:

#+begin_src shell
  $ sh ./runVirtualBoxLinux
#+end_src

If you have shared folders, mount -t vboxfs does not work. So you must
mount them with (on Linux) :

#+begin_src shell
  $ mount.vboxfs sharedfolder folderlocation
#+end_src

Your folder will be available at folderlocation.

** Command-line tips (not FreeBSD specific)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: command-line-tips-not-freebsd-specific
   :END:
*** Screenshot
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: screenshot
    :END:
A screenshot can be taken with the scrot functionnality with a delay,
for example 5 seconds :

#+begin_src shell
  $ scrot -d 5
#+end_src

*** Search files
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: search-files
    :END:
A very useful utility for finding quickly a file is locate. You will
need to keep its database though. For that, see
[[http://forums.freebsd.org/showthread.php?t=16100][the following
link]].

*** FTP upload
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ftp-upload
    :END:
Uploading files over FTP on the command-line can be done with

#+begin_src shell
  ncftpput -u LOGIN -p PASSWD IP remote_dir local_file
#+end_src
