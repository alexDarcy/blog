Here is a simple tip for splitting a large file into small chunks on
Linux and reassemble it on Windows. No need to install anything !

On Linux, split largefile into small files of 2040M named small00,
small01... :

#+begin_src shell
  $ split -b 2048m -d largefile small
#+end_src

On Windows, Assembling the files is simply done inside the DOS terminal
with :

#+begin_src shell
  $ copy /b small00 + small01 final
#+end_src

Don't forget to use the binary mode with /b, otherwise it will not work.
