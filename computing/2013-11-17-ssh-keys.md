If you often use SSH, you can be tired to type your password each time. The
solution is to use passphrases and to manage theme.
<!--more-->

## Generating a passphrase
First, check your <ic>~/.ssh</ic>. If it is empty, you will need to generate a
passphrase. For that, do :

``` bash
$ ssh-keygen -t 
```

And follow the instructions. Then you need to send your public key (by default <ic>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</ic> to the server. Do not send you private key !!!

``` bash
$ scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub mylogin@myserver:
```
    
Then connect to the server and add it to the list:    

``` bash
$ cat id_rsab.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
```

Then logout and try again to connect to the server. Now it should ask for your
passphrase.

## Managing passphrases (1)
If you are only using one terminal, the easiest solution is to do the following:

``` bash
$ eval `ssh-agent`
$ ssh-add
```

Enter your passphrase once and it will not ask for it again.

## Managing passphrases (2)
On the contrary, if you often switch between several terminals, you will need a
manager starting each time you open a new terminal.
For that, follow the excellent [instructions of Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/articles/openssh-key-management-p2.xml) for keychain.
