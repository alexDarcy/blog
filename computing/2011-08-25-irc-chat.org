For this part we will see how to communicate with the rest of the world.
We will use jabber protocol to connect to Gtalk (but several others are
available, see at the end).

First, we need an application for chatting. Irssi will be our weapon of
choice. At first it was aimed towards IRC users but some applications
provide a tunnel to. In most Linux and BSD distribution you can find one
of these : it is called bitlebee. The latest versions support now MSN.

See the [[http://www.irssi.org/themefiles/xchat.png][xchat theme]] for
an overview of the final result.

** Setting it up
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: setting-it-up
   :END:
After the installation of bitlbee, a local server should have been start
(otherwise, just start it with /etc/init.d/bitlbee start).

Then launch irssi. The first time, it will not connect to any server nor
join any channel though. So we will connect manually to your local
bitlbee :

#+begin_src shell
  /connect localhost 
#+end_src

This will display some funny message from the developper. Now register
an account (for the bitlbee server) :

#+begin_src shell
  register yourpassword 
#+end_src

** Connecting with OAuth
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: connecting-with-oauth
   :END:
Then you can add an Gtalk account:

#+begin_src shell
  account add jabber youraddress@gmail.com
#+end_src

You can try OAuth identification with

#+begin_src shell
  acc gtalk set oauth on 
  acc gtalk on
#+end_src

You should have received a private message by now. Follow the link and
get the confirmation code. Paste it in the window and it should connect
automatically.

** Connecting without OAuth
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: connecting-without-oauth
   :END:
For other protocols :

#+begin_src shell
  account add jabber youraddress@hotmail.com msnpassword 
#+end_src

Finally, save your account with

#+begin_src shell
  register bitlbeepassword
  save
#+end_src

This password is only used to register your bitlbee account. Do not use
your Google password.

##Â Configuration files If everything is allright, your contact list
should be displayed. However we want to avoid to type anything. In fact,
the connection should be automatic. For that purpose, edit your
configuration file in /.irssi/config. First we connect automatically to
the local bitlbee server. Add some line in the server list. It should
look like this :

#+begin_src shell
  servers = ( 
    { address = "eu.irc6.net"; chatnet = "IRCnet"; port = "6667"; },
    {
      address = "localhost";
      chatnet = "Bitlbee";
      port = "6667";
      autoconnect = "yes";
    }
  ); 
#+end_src

Then the connection to the bitlbee account (and thus to your MSN
account) should be automatic. Edit the chatnet part :

#+begin_src shell
  chatnets = { 
  IRCnet = { 
    type = "IRC";
    max_kicks = "4";
    max_msgs = "5";
    max_whois = "4";
    max_query_chans = "5";
  };  
  Bitlbee = { 
  type = "IRC";
  autosendcmd   = "/^msg -bitlbee &bitlbee identify bitlbeepassword; \
      wait -bitlbee 2000";
  }
#+end_src

Beware, it's your bitlbee passowrd so set the permissions accordingly.
Restart irssi and you should be all set ! You can message your friends
with

#+begin_src shell
  /msg apseudonym.
#+end_src

For more informations about the use and configuration of irssi, see this
post.

** Remarks
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: remarks
   :END:

- To ignore messages from ServerMode :

#+begin_src shell
  /ignore &bitlbee MODES
#+end_src

- For Google+ contacts, you should set :

#+begin_src shell
  account gtalk set nick_format %full_name
#+end_src

- Other protocols you can use with bitlbee : Gmail, Jabber, Yahoo,
  Twitter and even Facebook (see this page for Facebook) !
- We have configured a local server but you can also use a public one.
