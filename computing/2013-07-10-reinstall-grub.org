Here is how to reinstall your Grub if it has been wiped out by a Windows
install for example. This will deal with a small Debian Live USB.

The easiest solution would be to create an Ubuntu Live USB and to follow
[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows][these
instructions]]. For small USB keys, it's best to use a Debian
netinstall, which weighs around 10M.

** Create live usb
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: create-live-usb
   :END:
First, we need to ensure the usb has a partition with the correct
format. As a superutilisateur run:

#+begin_src shell
  $ fdisk /dev/sdc
#+end_src

whire /dev/sdc is your USB partition (the whole device, so not /dev/sdc1
which is a partition). Then create a FAT32 partition:

#+begin_src shell
  n
  p
  1
  [Enter]
  [Enter]
#+end_src

Make it FAT32:

#+begin_src shell
  t
  b
#+end_src

Make it bootable and write the change to disks

#+begin_src shell
  a
  w
#+end_src

Finally, format it, just to be sure :

#+begin_src shell
  $ mkfs.vfat /dev/sdc1
#+end_src

Now we need to copy an image on it. The first solution is to use a
program called [[http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/][unetbootin]] and
follow the instructions.

If it does not work, get the .iso and write it on the device (not the
partition):

#+begin_src shell
  $ dd if=my.iso of=/dev/sdc
#+end_src

** Reinstall grub
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: reinstall-grub
   :END:
Now boot from the USB, start install and go to partitoning step. Then go
the the shell with Alt-F2. Mount the partition containing your root
folder, along with /dev :

#+begin_src shell
  $ mkdir /target
  $ mount /dev/sdb1 /target
  $ mount --bind /dev /target/dev
#+end_src

Chroot into it and reinstall grub (to the correct device, which should
be (hd0) but do not take my word for it):

#+begin_src shell
  $ chroot /target
  $ grub-install '(hd0)'
#+end_src

And there you are, just reboot and everything is back to normal.
