A small post about protecting your desktop.

If you are using Gnome, you should be able to lock the screen with
Ctr-ALt-Del.

If you prefere ligthweight programs, I tried slock but did not really
like it as it is not clear when the deskop is locked. i3Lock is similar
but is an improved version. Finally, xtrlock is the one I use currently.
