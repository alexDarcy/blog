Just a quick post about my setup.

Prior to Wheezy, I had to install the latest alsa from the website. Lo
and behold, sound was working directly with the new release, Wheezy.
Unfortunately, mpd was no longer working. The log said something like :

#+begin_src shell
  can't find alsa mixer control "PCM"
#+end_src

Looking into the system logs showed up weird messages like :

#+begin_src shell
  Unable to contact D-Bus: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NotSupported:
  Unable to autolaunch a dbus-daemon without a $DISPLAY for X11
#+end_src

It turns out
[[http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=690530][these error
messages are normal]]. So I figured pulseaudio was causing these
problems. But removing it would mean removing gnome (as a dependency).
It is still possible as gnome and gnome-core are metapackages.

The final step is to manage the system bell, which was still beeping.
Pulseaudio was the only way to manage sound from the desktop preference.

The solution ? Disable the bell in your terminal.

And there, you're set !
