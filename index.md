Hello, my name is Alexis Praga.

I am an engineer specialized in computer science and applied mathematics. 
Fascinated by computational mathematics, I am currently doing a Ph.D at the 
CERFACS laboratory in Toulouse, France (see my [other webpage](http://cerfacs.fr/~praga)
for more details about it).
If you are interested, my CV is available in
[French](http://alexis.praga.free.fr/files/cv_alexis_praga_fr.pdf "French CV") 
or in [English](http://alexis.praga.free.fr/files/cv_alexis_praga_en.pdf "English CV").

This website is about some of my projects in [Applied
Mathematics](/projects/index.html) and some cool stuff related to
[Computer Science](/computing/index.html). You can see this site as a
journal of my various experiments.

Thanks for visiting !
