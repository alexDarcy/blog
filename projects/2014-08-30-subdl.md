A Perl script to get the subtitles for your favorite movie or TV show.
<!--more-->

The idea is to provide a portable and simple way to fetch subtitles from the
command line. The site is [OpenSubtitles.org](http://www.opensubtitles.org),
which provides a nice API. For portability, I chose Perl.

## Usage

The script must be applied only to a single file, for which it search all
corresponding subtitles on OpenSubtitles.org and then download it:

``` console
$ perl subdl-perl YourMovie.mkv
```

It is up to you to select which one is the best for your file. I thought about
making this choice automatically, for example by using a fuzzy on the subtitle
names, but it is not always a good solution. So I left that up to the user. 

The script works by creating the hash and comparing to the hash stored on the
server, so the match may not always be accurate. In practice, it works well
enough. The code source from the hash is [not from
me](http://trac.opensubtitles.org/projects/opensubtitles/wiki/HashSourceCodes).

Finally, it only search english subtitles. 

If you want more features, add them on the [issues
tracker](https://github.com/alexDarcy/subdl-perl/issues).
